# Neural Fish Tank
Watch demo of the texture generation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSWwnWDtGEs

To setup the game with texture generation, modify "main.go" to fit your server environment, and setup https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style I used an Ubuntu server with three Titan X gfx cards.

In Unity change the style textures in the TexturePass components on the top three game objects in the scene.
